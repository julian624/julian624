Hi, I'm Julian Perez I'm 25 years old and I'm a Front end react developer. I'm currently working as Front end on a nft game called ludus game and a blockchain project called hunters pride also i colaorate in Nof! a card game. The resources and frameworks I use most frequently are Sass, React, Nextjs, Framer motion, Gsap, Api rest, git, mobile first, performance and clean architecture among several others. I like Animations, 3d design, Web3 and creative developing.
https://julianperezcv.vercel.app/ my portfolio, although it's a bit outdated since I haven't modified it since 2021.

My latest and best repositories are private, as they are part of jobs, so in an interview I would like to show some of my current level of coding.
